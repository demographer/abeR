Description: This package implements the ABE method for historical record linking. 
    The methodology was developed by Ran Abramitzky, Leah Platt Boustan, and Katherine Eriksson 
    (\href{https://ranabr.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj5391/f/abe_ageofmassmigration.pdf}{2012}, 
    \href{https://ranabr.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj5391/f/abe_assimilation_1.pdf}{2014}, 
    \href{https://ranabr.people.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj5391/f/return-migrants.pdf}{2017}). 
    The original Stata implementation of the method can be found in 
    \href{https://ranabr.people.stanford.edu/matching-codes}{Ran Abramitzky's website}. 
    NYSIIS name standardization and Jaro-Winkler adjustment are currently not supported by this R package.
